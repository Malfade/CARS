				<h3>Cars backstory</h3>
				<p>
					I think it's pretty obvious that Masha and Shin became friends after Tenkaichi Budokai (aka Majin Buu saga). It was actually quite funny because Masha fell in love with Shin almost immediately, while Shin hardly even paid attention to her lol. However, they soon had a heart-to-heart talk, after which he became interested in her. They became friends because Masha often visited Shin with Goku's help, who, by the way, at some point got tired of constantly teleporting her back and forth, so Masha asked Bulma to make some kind of device like a phone so that she and Shin could stay in touch. In fact, from the outside, their relationship always seemed romantic, but since both Shin and Masha are idiots and think "this is just her/his way of showing love to friends", they remained "friends" for around a year.

I like to think that Shin is obsessed with his status as a god because it's basically the only thing he has left, so for a very long time it seemed to him that he HAD to uphold a certain image and he came up with "rules" for himself. When Shin realized that the feelings he had for Masha were far from friendly, he was literally horrified of not being good enough for his status. So yeah, he decided to distance himself from Masha.

This happened so abruptly that Masha became confused and immediately tried to find out what was going on, but Shin simply brushed it off. Eventually Masha couldn't take it anymore and confessed her feelings to Shin, but he, out of shock and not knowing what to do, said that they couldn't be together, because Masha was a cursed demon and "they weren't meant to be together."

I want to say that this one phrase broke Masha completely, because all her life she felt like an outsider, as if she had no place among all her friends, because her curse always carried a potential threat to those around her. Shin was one of the few people she thought accepted her for who she was.

After this conversation, Masha went home and had a panic attack. It is obvious that after something like this there can be no talk of any friendship between them. Yet.
